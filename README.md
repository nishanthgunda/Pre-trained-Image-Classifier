### Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

This project was part of the [AI-Programming with Python Nanodregree by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089).

##### Project Objectives:
    Identify Dogs vs. Non-Dogs:
    Correctly classify pet images as dogs or non-dogs, even if the breed is misidentified.
##### Classify Dog Breeds:
    Accurately determine the breed of dog for images that are indeed dogs.
    Compare CNN Architectures:
    Evaluate the performance of ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG models in achieving objectives 1 and 2.
##### Time Efficiency:
    Consider the computational resources required for each model and determine if a less computationally intensive alternative would provide satisfactory results.
